    "paragraph1": "I've always been a big fan of dark themes — Ayu Dark, Dracula, Darcula, Night Owl, and many others. But all of them had one thing that always made me go back to my own customizations: they looked too bright 😅. They're not \"light\" themes, of course, but none of them truly delivered a real #000 with a comfortable contrast for the eyes.",
    "paragraph2": "The few full-black themes I found had the opposite problem: overly harsh contrast, poor color customization, and any color applied over pure black ended up looking way too intense.",
    "paragraph3": "So I finally decided to do something about it and thought:",
    "quote": "\"Many people must feel the same way. I'll take my internal theme tweaks, improve them, and share them online for anyone who wants to download.\"",
    "paragraph4": "And that's how Back to Black was born. Every time I tried other dark themes, I always ended up going back to black — literally, back to black.",
    "ps": "P.S.:",
    "paragraph5": "I later discovered there's a song by Amy Winehouse with the same name 😅. I had no idea when I created the theme and published it on VS Code. I just looked it up online to see if the name showed up anywhere — and that's when I found out. Great song, by the way!"
